  // Auto-pull skills from all org users on every SessionStart (5s timeout).

  // never rejects — all errors are swallowed inside. Hard opt-out:
  // HIVEMIND_AUTOPULL_DISABLED=1.
  // Notifications drain. Until this landed, Codex users never saw ANY
  // notification the framework produced — most damagingly the
  // `balance-exhausted` banner enqueued by deeplake-api's 402 handler. The
  // result was hivemind failing completely silently on Codex: captures and
  // recalls returned nothing and no CTA to top up ever surfaced (reported
  // 2026-08-12 in #platform).

  // on a hook's stdout and this hook already owns it, so we collect the
  // claimed notifications via the `deliver` override and merge them into the
  // single output object below.

  // catches internally); autoPullSkills never rejects.

  // Deadline: unlike Claude Code — where the drain is its own hook command —
  // this hook must ALSO deliver the memory/login context, and Codex kills the

  // drain (goals SQL retries behind a stalled network) would take the whole
  // hook down with it and drop everything, so we stop waiting well before
  // that. If the drain lands late, its notifications go back on the queue
  // for the next session rather than being marked shown but never rendered.

  // Codex SessionStart output schema (verified against
  // https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks and codex-rs source @ 0.130.0):
  //   - `systemMessage` (top-level): warning shown to the user in the TUI
  //     history cell as `warning: <text>`. Use sparingly — every line lands
  //     in the user's face. Only set on real CTAs.
  //   - `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`: ALSO user-visible in Codex,
  //     rendered as `hook context: <text>` in the same history cell. Unlike
  //     Claude Code (where additionalContext is invisible system-prompt
  //     injection), Codex eagerly leaks the model's context to the user.
  //     `common::append_additional_context` in codex-rs pushes the string
  //     to BOTH the user-visible entries vec AND the model context vec —
  //     there is no model-only path. `suppressOutput: true` is parsed but
  //     ignored for SessionStart, so we can't hide it either.
  // Practical consequence: keep additionalContext MINIMAL on Codex. The
  // bulky DEEPLAKE MEMORY tier doc + hivemind/skillify command list that
  // claude-code's hook injects via `context` would clobber the Codex UI
  // every session. Codex's skill autoloader already exposes hivemind/skillify
  // command surfaces via per-skill SKILL.md files; the model can discover
  // memory tiers via `hivemind --help` and `ls ~/.deeplake/memory/` on demand.
  // We therefore emit only login-state + version here, and trust the model
  // to bootstrap the rest.
  // The proactive memory instruction (check team memory + pull rules/goals)
  // is NOT injected here. Codex has no model-only channel — every
  // additionalContext byte is also rendered to the user as a `hook context:`
  // cell, so a per-session block would be visible noise. Instead that guidance
  // lives in the managed hivemind block of `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (written by
  // install-codex.ts), which Codex auto-loads into the model context every
  // session SILENTLY — no TUI cell. Empirically verified: a sentinel placed in
  // ~/.codex/AGENTS.md reaches the model without surfacing in the transcript.
  // So additionalContext stays minimal: login-state + version only.

  // Async auto-pull of the latest cloud snapshot for HEAD. Detached and
  // truly fire-and-forget — see src/graph/spawn-pull-worker.ts and
  // src/hooks/graph-pull-worker.ts. Lands for the NEXT SessionStart.
  //
  // Gate on creds: pullSnapshot would early-return "skipped-no-auth"
  // anyway when there's no token, but spawning a worker just to have it
  // exit is wasted process churn. The check also keeps the codex
  // session-start "spawn must not fire when unauthenticated" contract
  // (tests/codex/codex-session-start-hook.test.ts).
