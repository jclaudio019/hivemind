/**
 * Per-directory Hivemind config — an in-tree `.hivemind` file that overlays the
 * global identity (`~/.deeplake/credentials.json`) for sessions launched under
 * that directory. Two things it can do:
 *
 *   1. ROUTE — send this directory's captured traces to a specific
 *      org / workspace:
 *        { "orgId": "acme", "workspaceId": "clientA" }
 *   2. OPT OUT — never collect traces from this directory:
 *        { "collect": false }
 *
 * Two filenames are recognized at each level:
 *   - `.hivemind`        — meant to be COMMITTED (shared team routing, like
 *                          `.editorconfig`).
 *   - `.hivemind.local`  — meant to be GITIGNORED (a personal override /
 *                          opt-out, like `.env.local`). Wins over `.hivemind`
 *                          in the same directory.
 *
 * Discovery is nearest-wins: we walk UP from the session `cwd` and take the
 * first file found (like `.git`), so routing is unambiguous — NOT a
 * `.gitignore`-style merge across ancestors.
 *
 * The file NEVER carries a token — auth stays in `~/.deeplake/credentials.json`.
 * A routing override therefore only ever takes effect against orgs the user's
 * existing token already authorizes; the API rejects anything else. Where the
 * traces actually land is disclosed to the user in the session-start banner,
 * so a routing override is never silent.

 *     the global identity in `base`.
 *   - `collect` is the CAPTURE switch — writes only. It never suppresses the
 *     identity overlay, so `{ "collect": false, "workspaceId": "x" }` reads
 *     from `x` while writing nothing. (Reads are still authorized by the
 *     caller's existing token; the API rejects anything it doesn't grant.)
 *
 * Callers on the capture path must therefore gate on `collect`; callers on a
 * read path use `config` unconditionally.
 *
 * Precedence follows the conventional `env > config-file > stored-creds` order:
 * an explicitly-set `HIVEMIND_ORG_ID` / `HIVEMIND_WORKSPACE_ID` LOCKS that field
 * so a `.hivemind` routing value can't override it. (`base` already folded the
 * env var in via `loadConfig()`, so a locked field simply keeps `base`'s value.)
 * `collect: false` is unaffected by env — it's a fail-safe opt-out.
 *
 * Tests may inject the two lock vars via `envOverride`; in production the vars
 * are read as LITERAL `process.env.X` accesses (never an aliased `process.env`)
 * so the openclaw esbuild `define` stubs them to `undefined` and the ClawHub
 * env-harvesting scan stays clean — see the note in src/config.ts.
