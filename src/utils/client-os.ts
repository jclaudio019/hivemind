/**
 * X-Hivemind-OS header helper.
 *
 * The deeplake-api backend records the client OS on the signup analytics
 * events and forwards it to the marketing CRM, so "did this lead install on
 * Windows?" has an answer. `process.platform` is the only truthful source:
 * the server would see its own GOOS, and the CLI's HTTP client sends no OS
 * token in its User-Agent.
 *
 * Normalized here so the wire value is already the vocabulary the CRM reads.
 * The backend normalizes again on ingest (normalizeOS in auth_analytics.go)
 * because two other producers exist and disagree — hivemind.ps1 sends
 * "Windows" and hivemind.sh sends raw `uname -s` — so the canonical mapping
 * has to live at the backend boundary regardless. Sending the canonical name
 * from here keeps this CLI from being a third dialect.
 *
 * Platforms we do not ship an installer for omit the header entirely — an
 * absent property is more honest than a bucket named "other", and it matches
 * how the install-id header degrades.
 *
 * Header, not a dimension on X-Deeplake-Client: that header's value is a
 * parsed contract (product, optionally product/version) and overloading it
 * would break ParseClientHeader on the backend.
